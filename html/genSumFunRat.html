    <h1>Excess Funds Raised Per Category</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This table reports the amount of total excess funds raised per category as a multiplier of total goal amount</p>
    <p>ie: A value of 2.0 in column 'Excess Funds Raised Multiple' signifies twice as many dollars have been raised compared to the total goal amount for the entire category</p>
    <h2>Notable Observations</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Engineering related categories like "Design", "Games", and "Technology" tend to raise the most amount of excess funds</li>
      <li>Entertainment related categories like "Dance", "Theater", and "Music" tend to raise funds closer to their goal amount</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Client Recommendation</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Have realistic expectations if your campaign does not fall under a technology or engineering category</li>
      <li>Strongly consider Kickstarter if you have a project that is focused on engineering or technology</li>
      </ul>
