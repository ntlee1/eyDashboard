    <h2 style = "font-size: 28px">What Is This?</h2>
    <p style = "font-size:20px">This is a plot of how close failed campaigns came to reaching their goal amount as a percentage.</p>
    <p style = "font-size:20px">ie: A project in the percent bin `(0,10]` raised less than 10% of its required goal amount.</p>
    <h1 style = "font-size: 32px;">Notable Observations</h1>
    <ul>
      <li style = "font-size:16px">The majority of campaigns on Kickstarter don't even manage to raise 10% of their goal amount</li>
      <li style = "font-size:16px">It is a rare occurrence for a campaign to come close to reaching its goal amount. Either it succeeds or fails badly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style = "font-size: 32px;">Client Recommendation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li style = "font-size:16px">If you have a launched a campaign on Kickstarter and have not seen major traction within two weeks, save time and launch again.</li>
      <li style = "font-size:16px">Kickstarter heavily favors a binary success system. If a campaign fails badly do not be discouraged.</li>
