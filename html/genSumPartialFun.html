    <h1>Percent of Goal Reached</h1>
    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is a plot of how close failed campaigns came to reaching their goal amount as a percentage.</p>
    <p>ie: A project in the percent bin `(0,10]` raised less than 10% of its required goal amount.</p>
    <h1>Notable Observations</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>The majority of campaigns on Kickstarter dont even manage to raise 10% of their goal amount</li>
      <li>It is a rare occurance for a campaign to come close to reaching its goal amount. Either it succeeds or fails badly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1>Client Recommendation</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a launched a campaign on Kickstarter and have not seen major traction within two weeks, save time and launch again.</li>
      <li>Kickstarter heavily favors a binary success system. If a campaign fails badly do not be discouraged.</li>
    </ul>
